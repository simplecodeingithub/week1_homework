# Week 1 Homework

This repository contains the exercises for the first week of the coding course.

## Exercise 8

**Description:**

In this exercise, we worked on understanding basic Python concepts such as:

- Command-line arguments using the sys module.
- Dictionaries and their operations.
- Writing and running Python scripts.
- Using loops to count characters in strings.

**Files:**

- **say_my_name.py**  
  A script that prints the full name by concatenating first and last names from a dictionary.

- **anatomy.py**  
  A script demonstrating the use of command-line arguments and various Python concepts like if-else conditions, loops, and string formatting.

## Exercise 9

**Description:**

This exercise focused on mathematical computations and Python data types:

- Calculating the height of a projectile using physics formulas.
- Practicing arithmetic operations and the use of mathematical functions like math.tan() and math.cos().
- Exploring Python's fundamental data types such as lists, dictionaries, and strings.

**Files:**

- **projectile.py**  
  A program to calculate the height of a projectile based on the given initial velocity, angle, and other parameters.

- **operations.py**  
  A script demonstrating arithmetic operations, their applications, and the use of methods and functions.

- **types_practice.py**  
  A file containing practice examples for understanding Python data types and their mutability.
